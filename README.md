# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python â€“ Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository for **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** (CS50AI), offered by Harvard University and taught by Brian Yu. This repository showcases my work, implementations, and learning progress throughout the course.

## About the Course

CS50AI explores the foundational concepts behind artificial intelligence, including:

- Search algorithms
- Knowledge representation and logical inference
- Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning
- Machine learning (supervised and reinforcement)
- Natural language processing

The course combines theory with practical projects that apply AI to real-world challenges.

## Files system
* `0-1_degrees` : A graph-based search algorithm to identify the shortest path of connections between two actors using a dataset of movies and people
* `0-2_tictactoe` : An AI bot to beat you in tic-tac-toe

---
## Notes
* All projects are implemented individually as part of the CS50AI coursework.
* Some projects include starter code provided by the course; the core logic (especially AI algorithms) is implemented by me.
