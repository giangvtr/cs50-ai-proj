# 🎓 CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python – Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository for **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** (CS50AI), offered by Harvard University and taught by Brian Yu. This repository showcases my work, implementations, and learning progress throughout the course.

## 📚 About the Course

CS50AI explores the foundational concepts behind artificial intelligence, including:

- Search algorithms
- Knowledge representation and logical inference
- Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning
- Machine learning (supervised and reinforcement)
- Natural language processing

The course combines theory with practical projects that apply AI to real-world challenges.
